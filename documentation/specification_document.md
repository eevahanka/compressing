# specification document

This is computer science (tkt) students project for Data Structures Project course.

## language

This project will use Python.
Which pretty mutch the only language I know.

Documentation and comments in code etc. will be in english.

## algorihims and 

I will be compairing Lempel-Ziv and Huffman coding algorithims in datacompressing.

There isn't a real reason for choosing these algorithims, main reason is that they were the suggested ones and I didn't find better options with a quick glance.

## input and output

Input given to program is txt file and output will be hopefully significantly smaller file

## target 

Target is to be able reduce file sice 40-60% without any information lost and to be able to uncompress the files
