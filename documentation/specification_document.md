# specification document
This is computer science (tkt) students project for Data Structures Project course.
## language
This project will use Python.
Which pretty much the only language I know.
Documentation and comments in code etc. will be in English.
## algorithms and 
I will be comparing Lempel-Ziv-Welch and Huffman coding algorithms in datacompressing.
There isn't a real reason for choosing these algorithms, main reason is that they were the suggested ones and I didn't find better options with a quick glance.
## input and output
Input given to program is text file and output will be hopefully significantly smaller file
## target 
Target is to be able reduce file sice 40-60% without any information lost and to be able to uncompress the files
