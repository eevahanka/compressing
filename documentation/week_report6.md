This week I have made Lempel–Ziv–Welch algorithm and some changes to how I save my files, becouse of a bug.

Next I'll do some refactoring, there are some things that I could replace with list comprehension, and other things that could be done a bit smarter. Also there are some ideas that I could use to save a byte or two from my compressed files so I'm thinking of implementing those if theres time. I'm also missing some documentation so I have some cathing up to do with those...

I used 12 hours this week
