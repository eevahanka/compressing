On monday I've configurated poetry and added dependensies there.
Also started my ui, which will be very simple commandline ui.
I made ui_test to be ready for tests, but i'm yet to implement something that I could actually test.

I strugled a lot with poetry becouse I could not get version dependensies to work, even if I checked old project and used the exact same versions. Then I swiched computers and it worked perfectly. My therory is that my computers python version is the problem so I'll need to look into that at some point. Becouse I can only work on this project on my fuxiläppäri.
I also had problem with getting testcoverage badge to github, I just couldn't figure it out. But i gave up on it and desided to do it some other day.

I have mostly rehearsed my git and poetry skills today.

Next up I will figure out how I want to get files, and implement that. I'm thinking of asking for file path from user and/or having ready options for user (so I could just add files to directory if I want to be able to use them for this). Becouse I want it to be reasonably easy to use for user and in tests and to implement. And I really don't want to just input a long string...

Also figure out if I can check files size in a python program, and of course implement it.

I used 5 hours on monday
