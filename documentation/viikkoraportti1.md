This week I've mainly fought with Github which doesn't seem to be working at all rightnow. I've also created Github repo and specification document there. And registered to this course in Labtool

I've mainly learned the very basics of how my algorthims work.

Next I'll start coding and when github works I'll create some directories and clone the repository to my computer.
Also I'll initialize my project.
