This week I have made the rest of huffmans algorithm mainly the part that decode correct file from binary. I also tried to make ui work with huffmans algorithm but although tests work perfectly when I'm using ui I get incorrect binary from the encoded file.
Next I'll start working on lzw.
I have used this week 18 hours
