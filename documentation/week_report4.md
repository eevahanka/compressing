This week I have coded a working huffmans algorithm

This week I have learned that I should use bytes to save binary data, but Im yet to learn how to do it. I also needed to use overloading to get heaps working with my own objects.

Difficult was converting data back from bytes to binary, I think that at this point I have gone through whole internet and there haven't been anything that has helped. I also could be missing someting becouse it would be wierd if I were the only person ever with this problem

Next I'll make it possible to un compress files and start working on the next algorithm

I used this week about 18 hours
