This week I have made more tests, and testing document. I have also started working on the huffman algorithm. I also have been reading about my algorithms and planning how I'm going to implement them.

I also tried again to get my coverage report to code cow but I still haven't managed to do it.

Next I'll continue working on huffmans algorithm starting with the binary tree that it needed for it.
